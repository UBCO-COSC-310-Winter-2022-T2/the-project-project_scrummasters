# Dashboard Summary

## Milestone 5
### What's Done: Database, Sign Up, Log In, and Navigation bar is created, along with proper authentication and setting of session states to track whether a user is logged in, Kanban board, and proper organization of files and modularization of code.
### What's Left: CRUD (Create Read Update and Delete) on servers, messages, and friends, and editing of account information
### What's Working: All currently completed tasks are working.
### The Process So Far: Everything is working well so far, although figuring out the testing process was fairly challenging at first, albeit that has now been mitigated
### Release Branch: The Main Branch consists of our working copy
